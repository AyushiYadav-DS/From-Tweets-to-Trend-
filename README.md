# From-Tweets-to-Trend(analyse the impact of social media sentiments on stock price)

<b> Objective </b> 
This project analyzes the impact of social media sentiments on stock price movements using sentiment analysis and data visualization. By leveraging machine learning techniques and interactive dashboards, the project helps uncover correlations between public sentiment and stock trends. An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize key insights.

<b> Data Collection & Preprocessing </B>
Dataset:
1) Collected stock price data from financial APIs (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage)
2) Extracted tweets related to stocks using Twitter API & Kaggle datasets
3) As part of the preprocessing step,
- Tweet Cleaning: Remove links, hashtags, stopwords 
- For tweets cleaning  I used NLTK (natural language tool kit)

5) I performed sentiment analysis on tweet data to extract insights about market sentiment.

â€¢ Also, calculated the Sentiment Score, This sentiment analysis helped quantify social media sentiment, allowing for a deeper understanding of its impact on stock price movements.<br>
For this analysis I used TextBlob, a natural language processing (NLP) library.<br>
TextBlob analyzes the polarity of each tweet, assigning a sentiment score ranging from -1 to +1.<br>
Based on these scores, tweets were categorized as<br>

1) positive

2) neutral

3) negative
